# Advent of Code Python Solutions

This repository contains solutions to the coding challenges from the Advent of Code website. Each year, Advent of Code releases a series of 25 coding challenges, one for each day leading up to Christmas. The challenges can be solved in any programming language, but this repository contains solutions in Python.

## Getting Started

To get started with these solutions, first clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/advent-of-code-python.git
```

### Prerequisites

To run the solutions, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your machine.

### Running the Solutions

Each year's solutions are contained in a separate directory named after the year (e.g. `2015`, `2016`, etc.). Within each year's directory, the solutions for each day are contained in a separate Python file named after the day (e.g. `day01.py`, `day02.py`, etc.).

To run a solution, simply execute the corresponding Python file from the command line:

```
python src/2021/day06/advent6.py
```

### Input Data

The input data for each day's challenge is stored in a text file with a name matching the day's Python file, but with the `.txt` extension (e.g. `2015/day01.txt`, `2015/day02.txt`, etc.). The input data is read into the Python solution using the `open()` function.

## Contributing
